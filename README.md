## Features
1. Randomly generated 4-16 character long passwords.
2. The password contains four combinations of options:
  - Include Lowercase Characters
  - Include Uppercase Characters
  - Include Numbers
  - Include Symbols
3. Users can specify which characters to exclude.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. You have installed Node.js and npm. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that is required to run the server-side code. npm is a package manager for Node.js that is used to install dependencies.
2. You have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js.

## Installation and Execution

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/chien333666/restaurant-list.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd restaurant-list

3. Install the dependencies:
npm install

   This command installs all the necessary dependencies for the project.

4. Start the server:
npm start

   The server will start, and you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

### Note

Ensure that the port `3000` is not being used by another application. If it is, you can change the port in the `app.js` file by modifying the `port` variable.
